## Twitter Sentiment Analysis  

### 📌 Overview  
This project analyzes sentiments from Twitter data using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify tweets as **positive, negative, or neutral**, providing insights into public opinion on a given topic.

### 📂 Project Files  
- **`Twitter Sentiment Analysis.ipynb`** – The main Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and sentiment classification.  

### 🚀 Features  
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Sentiment Classification using Machine Learning or Deep Learning  
- Data Visualization for Insights  
- Model Evaluation & Performance Metrics  

### 🔧 Installation & Setup  
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.  
2. Install required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter or Google Colab.  

### 📊 Usage  
1. Load the dataset containing tweets.  
2. Preprocess text data (remove stopwords, lemmatization, etc.).  
3. Train a sentiment analysis model.  
4. Predict and visualize sentiment trends.  

### 🏆 Results  
The notebook includes performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate sentiment classification models.  

### 📌 Future Improvements  
- Implement deep learning-based sentiment analysis (e.g., LSTMs, transformers).  
- Use real-time Twitter data via the Twitter API.  
- Improve sentiment accuracy with advanced NLP techniques.
